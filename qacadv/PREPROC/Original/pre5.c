 *
 *  Description:  Uses a DEFINE_MAX macro which creates a max function
 *                for a certain type, which is provided as a parameter.
 *
 *                The CALL_MAX macro invokes this function with parameters.
 *
 *                The main benefit of this approach is that the parameters
 *                are only evaluated once when being passed into the  
 *                function, rather than being expanded potentially many 
 *                times (as in a macro).
