 *  Description:  This program calculates the upper and lower limits for
 *                a specific implementation of the standard library
 *                time calculations. That is to say, everyone uses a
 *                value representing the number of seconds past a given date
 *                and time. However the "given date and time" vary. This
 *                program finds out what this date and time is. Also, because
 *                the number has a fixed size, it has a fixed maximum. Thus
 *                there is some date beyond which representation will cause
 *                overflow and error. This date is calculated too.
